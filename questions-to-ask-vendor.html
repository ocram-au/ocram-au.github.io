        <h2>Questions to Ask Vendor Proposing a Solution or Application</h1>
        <div class="mdl-grid">
            <div class="mdl-cell mdl-cell--12-col">Bamboozled by what vendors are proposing, especially when just starting out. No worries use the following questions to cover some areas which are important to consider. 
                If they cannot answer these clearly, concisely and in a timely fashion, or indicate "they are working on it", then their product/system/service may not be mature enough to provide the service and security you should expect, or simply they do not know what they are talking about.

This enhances the security of the system as when a use leaves and organisational, access to the application is automatically removed when their organisational  login is disabled.

                        <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Having official documentation allows any organisation staff to use the documentation as reference to answer any questions which may not have been covered.
For example security specialist will have a set of criteria which the system needs to pass before it can be used for a pilot or even production. These documents saves having to have meetings to clarify specific questions.
Also any claims by the vendor should be backed up with official documentation, not just their say so or via emails.
Any vendor which uses AWS, Azure or andy other reputable cloud service provider for their data storage and application service should immediately be able to provide links to these cloud services security documents.

                        <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">How does the system integrate with 3rd party systems? Does it store username and password of the other system, or does it ask for a token to use to gain access?</td>
                        <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND!
Any system which stores the username and password, or credentials of another system is a MAJOR SECURITY RISK! If it does DO NOT USE IT!
For example if a GIS web application can consume data from another application, for example <a href="https://www.teambinder.com" target="_blank">TeamBinder</a> and that application asks for your username and password to synchronies the data then this is a major security risk.
No system should store or ask for a users credentials directly to access data or processes from another system.</td>
                        <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">There are a number of ways data from 3rd party systems can be accessed. One of the most common is using a token which is associated with the application which is asking for access and has an expiration date. This means the token and only be used by the application and does not work after a certain date.
A secure way a token can be generated is the application url is registered with the 3rd part system it wants to access. When the application tries to access this data it checks if a token is sent and valid. If not token is present, the it will check to see if the url of the application is registered and allowed, when it is, the 3rd party system will go to its authentication process to authenticate the user. When successful a token will be generated and passed back to the requesting application via a callback url. This callback will initiate a process to store the token and subsequent calls to the 3rd party system will pass the token to authorise access.
<a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/security/app-credential-authentication/">ESRI ArcGIS Application Credential Authentication</a> is an example of how this is done.

                        <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">With the release of Google Maps, <a href="https://epsg.io/900913" target="_blank">Google Maps Global Mercator</a> has become a popular default map projection to use and is supported by many mapping applications. This projection is more commonly now known as <a href="https://epsg.io/3857" target="_blank">WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator</a>. This map projection does serve a purpose at a "Global" scale, that is when data covers the entire earth this would be a map projection to consider.
Most specialist applications in my opinion are at a local, region, state or country scale, and as such should use the appropriate scale.
EG. Melbourne: <a href="https://epsg.io/7855" target="_blank">GDA2020 / MGA zone 55</a>, Victoria: <a href="https://epsg.io/7899" target="_blank">GDA2020 / Vicgrid</a>, Australia: <a href="https://epsg.io/7844" target="_blank">GDA2020</a></td>
                        <td class="mdl-data-table__cell--non-numeric">Would expect to use map projection relative to the area. Usually data is collected in the relevant map projection or re-projected to that projection from GPS collected data. If the data is re-projected to be displayed in in the application other than the projection used for data collection, then errors in the data will be introduced. This is especially important to consider when dealing with critical infrastructure data such as utilities.</td>

Every Geospatial application and process must be able to produce and consume metadata. Anything other than that indicates it is not worthy to use.

Metadata standards have been around since the 1980s.
